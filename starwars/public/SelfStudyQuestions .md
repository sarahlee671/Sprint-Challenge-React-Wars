1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is a UI library that renders User Interface. It solves the problems of scalability and is able to be reused. If the DOM has data that changes constantly, react does it without having to reload using the virtual DOM. Since react is built in components, it'll receive new information and only update the components that use the same data. React updates information quickly and smoothly.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

When we think in react, we need to break down the elements into components. A component should ideally only do one thing. If it does multiple things, that component should be broken down into smaller sub-components.


3.  Describe state.

State is the data that our components can hold and pass around to other components. When state updates, it'll update all the other components holding that data. State is what drives our application and it is mutable through setState.


5.  Describe props.

Props takes the data from State and can pass around that data to other components. If state is our heart, props is the blood. Props can only pass around the information from state. It can't be changed and components can't modify their own prop.
